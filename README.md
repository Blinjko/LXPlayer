# Notice #
I have decided to remake this application, because the original design was just bad. I made things more complicated than needed, causing excess code to be written
and overall bad performance. The new code is simpler and more perfomant that the old code. The code is also very messy, and lacking comments, I will fix this
by cleaning up code and adding comments where needed. The new code I have written is closely knit together, and purpose built just for this application, but I think
it is still very simple and easy to understand for anyone who wants to read it.
